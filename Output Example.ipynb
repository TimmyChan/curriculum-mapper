      "This course introduces key concepts and techniques for characterizing, from observational or experimental study data and from background information, the causal effect of a specific treatment, exposure, or intervention (e.g., a medical treatment) upon an outcome of interest (e.g., disease status). The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.  Course grading will be based on quizzes, homeworks, a class presentation, and a causal data analysis project.\n",

      "Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms that \"learn\" and improve with experience,  While the broad aim behind research in this area is to build systems that can simulate or even improve on certain aspects of human intelligence, algorithms developed in this area have become very useful in analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex systems.  Machine learning algorithms have been used to guide diagnostic systems in medicine, recommend interesting products to customers in e-commerce, play games at human championship levels, and solve many other very complex problems.  This course is focused on algorithms for machine learning: their design, analysis and implementation.  We will study different learning settings, including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.  We will study different ways of representing the learning problem, using propositional, multiple-instance and relational representations.  We will study the different algorithms that have been developed for these settings, such as decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, k-means, harmonic functions and Bayesian methods.  We will learn about the theoretical tradeoffs in the design of these algorithms, and how to evaluate their behavior in practice.  At the end of the course, you should be able to:\n",
      "   --Recognize situations where machine learning algorithms are applicable;\n",
      "   --Understand, represent and formulate the learning problem;\n",
      "   --Apply the appropriate algorithm(s), or if necessary, design your own, with an understanding of the tradeoffs involved;\n",

      "The Fundamentals of Robotics course will expose students to fundamental principles of robotics.  Students will explore high level conceptual foundations of robotics beginning with Braitenberg vehicles and apply this knowledge to simulated and physical robot hardware in laboratory experiences and in a final project.  Laboratory experiences will guide students through applying theory to practice increasingly complex tasks in a project oriented, group work environment.  The course culminates in a robotics challenge project at the end of the semester.  Topics covered are: sensors, actuators, kinematics, control, planning and programming.  Programming languages and concepts (e.g., C++, object oriented programming) used in robotics will be introduced and used with modern robotics programming toolboxes and frameworks.  Prior experience with these languages will not be necessary.  Previous experience with robotics is not required for this course.\n",

Machine learning algorithms have been used to guide diagnostic systems in medicine, recommend interesting products to customers in e-commerce, play games at human championship levels, and solve many other very complex problems. This course is an introduction to algorithms for machine learning and their implementation in the context of big data. We will study different learning settings, the different algorithms that have been developed for these settings, and learn about how to implement these algorithms and evaluate their behavior in practice. We will also discuss dealing with noise, missing values, scalability properties and talk about tools and libraries available for these methods.\n",

Responsibilities include creating a game idea, writing a story, developing the artwork, designing characters, implementing music and sound effects, programming and testing the game, and publishing the final project. Students enrolled in 487 will develop a healthcare or education virtual environment or video game in collaboration with a mentor who has expertise in the chosen area.\n",

The course begins with one-to-one operations such as image addition and subtraction and image descriptors such as the histogram.  Basic filters such as the gradient and Laplacian in the spatial domain are used to enhance images.  The 2-D Fourier transform is introduced and frequency domain operations such as high and low-pass filtering are developed.  It is shown how filtering techniques can be used to remove noise and other image degradation.  The different methods of representing color images are described and fundamental concepts of color image transformations and color image processing are developed.  One or more advanced topics such as wavelets, image compression, and pattern recognition will be covered as time permits.  Programming assignments using software such as MATLAB will illustrate the application and implementation of digital image processing.\n",
