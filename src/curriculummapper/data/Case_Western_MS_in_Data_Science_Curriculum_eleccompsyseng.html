<p>The ECSE Department spans a spectrum of topics from (i) materials, devices, circuits, and processors through (ii) control, signal processing, and systems analysis to (iii) human-machine interfaces, computation, computer systems, embedded systems and networking.  The ECSE Department at Case Western Reserve supports three synergistic degree programs: Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Systems &amp; Control Engineering. Each degree program leads to the Bachelor of Science degree at the undergraduate level.  At the graduate level, the department offers the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Systems &amp; Control Engineering.  We offer minors in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Systems &amp; Control Engineering, and also in Computer Gaming, and Electronics.  For supplemental information to this bulletin as well as the latest updates, please visit the ECSE Department website at <span id="docs-internal-guid-1ad294d6-7fff-4276-d146-b63149d8b651"><a href="https://engineering.case.edu/electrical-computer-and-systems-engineering">https://engineering.case.edu/electrical-computer-and-systems-engineering</a>.</span></p>
<p>ECSE is at the heart of modern technology.  ECSE disciplines are responsible for the devices and microprocessors powering our computers and embedded into everyday devices, from cell phones and tablets to automobiles and airplanes.  Healthcare is increasingly building on ECSE technologies: micro/nano-systems, electronics/instrumentation, implantable systems, embedded microprocessors, wireless medical devices, surgical robots, imaging, system biology, and visualization.  The future of energy will be profoundly impacted by ECSE technologies, from smart appliances connected to the Internet, smart buildings that incorporate distributed sensing and control, to the envisioned smart grid that must be controlled, stabilized, and kept secure over an immense network.  ECSE drives job creation and starting salaries in our fields are consistently ranked at the top of all college majors.  Our graduates work in cutting-edge companies--from giants to start-ups, in a variety of technology sectors, including computer and internet, healthcare and medical devices, manufacturing and automation, automotive and aerospace, defense, finance, energy, and consulting. </p>
<h2>Educational Philosophy</h2>
<p>The ECSE department is dedicated to developing high-quality graduates who will take positions of leadership as their careers advance.  We recognize that the increasing role of technology in virtually every facet of our society, life, and culture makes it vital that our students have access to progressive and cutting-edge higher education programs.  The core values for all of the degree programs in the department are:</p>
<ul>
<li>mastery of fundamentals</li>
<li>creativity</li>
<li>social awareness</li>
<li>leadership skills</li>
<li>professionalism</li>
</ul>
<p>Stressing excellence in these core values helps to ensure that our graduates are valued and contributing members of our global society and that they will carry on the tradition of engineering leadership established by our alumni.</p>
<p>Our goal is to graduate students who have fundamental technical knowledge of their profession and the requisite technical breadth and communications skills to become leaders in creating the new techniques and technologies which will advance their fields.  To achieve this goal, the department offers a wide range of technical specialties consistent with the breadth of electrical engineering, computer engineering, and systems &amp; control engineering, including recent developments in the fields.  Because of the rapid pace of advancement in these fields, our degree programs emphasize a broad and foundational science and technology background that equips students for future developments.  Our programs include a wide range of electives and our students are encouraged to develop individualized programs which can combine many aspects of electrical engineering, computer engineering, and systems &amp; control engineering.</p>

<p>In consultation with a faculty advisor, a student completes the program by selecting technical and open elective courses that provide in-depth training in one or more of a spectrum of specialties, such as, control, signal processing, electronics, integrated circuit design and fabrication, and robotics. With the approval of the advisor, a student may emphasize other specialties by selecting elective courses from other programs or departments.</p>
<p>Additionally, math and statistics classes are highly recommended as an integral part of the student's technical electives to prepare for work in industry and government and for graduate school. The following math/statistics classes are recommended and would be accepted as approved technical electives:</p>

</ul>
<p>Other Math/Statistics may be used as technical electives with the approval of the student's academic advisor.</p>
<p>Many courses have integral or associated laboratories in which students gain “hands-on” experience with electrical engineering principles and instrumentation. Students have ready access to the teaching laboratory facilities and are encouraged to use them during non-scheduled hours in addition to the regularly scheduled laboratory sessions. Opportunities also exist for undergraduate student participation in the wide spectrum of research projects being conducted in the department.</p>

<p>In consultation with a faculty advisor, a student completes the program by selecting technical and open elective courses that provide in-depth training in the principles and practice of computer engineering. Students must take 5-6 courses, that add up to 18 credit hours of technical electives, to fulfill this requirement. With the approval of the advisor, a student may emphasize a specialty of his/her choice by selecting elective courses from other programs or departments.</p>
<p>Many courses have integral or associated laboratories in which students gain “hands-on” experience with computer engineering principles and instrumentation. Students have ready access to the teaching laboratory facilities and are encouraged to use them during non-scheduled hours in addition to the regularly scheduled laboratory sessions. Opportunities also exist for undergraduate student participation in the wide spectrum of research projects being conducted in the department.</p>

<h4>Cooperative Education Program in Computer Engineering</h4>
<p>Opportunities are available for students to alternate studies with work in industry or government as a co-op student, which involves paid full-time employment over seven months (one semester and one summer). Students may work in one or two co-ops, beginning in the third year of study. Co-ops provide students the opportunity to gain valuable hands-on experience in their field by completing a significant engineering project while receiving professional mentoring. During a co-op placement, students do not pay tuition but maintain their full-time student status while earning a salary. Learn more at <a href="http://engineering.case.edu/coop">http://engineering.case.edu/coop/</a>. Alternatively or additionally, students may obtain employment as summer interns.</p>
<h4>BS/MS Program in Computer Engineering</h4>
<p>Highly motivated and qualified students are encouraged to apply to the BS/MS Program which will allow them to get both degrees in five years. The BS can be in Computer Engineering or a related discipline, such as mathematics or electrical engineering. Integrating graduate study in computer engineering with the undergraduate program allows a student to satisfy all requirements for both degrees in five years.  Review the <a href="/undergraduatestudies/gradprofessional/#accerlerationtowardgraduatedegreestext">Office of Undergraduate Studies BS/MS program requirements</a>.</p>

<h2 headerid="0" name="graduatetext">Graduate Programs</h2>
<h3 headerid="1" name="graduatetext">MS Degree Programs</h3>
<p>The Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering offers the following Master of Science degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical Engineering MS</li>
<li>Computer Engineering MS</li>
<li>Systems and Control Engineering MS</li>
</ul>
<h4>Admission</h4>
<p>Graduate students shall be admitted to one of three MS degree tracks (thesis-focused, project-focused, course-focused) upon recommendation of the faculty of the Department.  Requirements for admission include a strong record of scholarship in a completed bachelor's degree program in a field of engineering, mathematical or physical sciences, and fluency in written and spoken English. </p>
<p>For a thesis-focused or project-focused track, the University requires all foreign applicants to show English proficiency by achieving a TOEFL score of at least 90 on the internet-based exam.  For a course-focused track, a minimum TOEFL score of 80 is required.  If there is any professional student-to-student interaction, e.g. as a teaching assistant, a lab instructor, or a tutor, then a minimum TOEFL score of 90 is required. </p>
<p>It is required that all students submit original copies of GRE scores, with the exception of CWRU students applying to the BS/MS program.  Applications from students with a bachelor's degree in fields other than those listed above may be granted admission on a provisional basis.  Such provisional students may be advanced to full standing upon completion of prerequisite conditions stipulated in the letter of admission.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Course registration is performed through the Student Information System (SIS). Each semester before registration, students should update any personal information that may have changed by logging into SIS and editing the appropriate information.  All registration holds must be lifted in order to successfully complete the registration process.</p>
<h4>Advising</h4>
<p>Upon admission to the graduate program, each graduate student is assigned an academic advisor to assist in registration as well as planning a program of study (Academic Program).  This is a temporary assignment made by the Department Chairperson based on the student's academic and research interests as identified at the time of application.</p>
<p>During the first semester in the program, it is strongly suggested that each student meet with various members of faculty to discuss academic objectives/goals and research opportunities.  In order to complete the research component of their respective degree program, each student must identify a faculty member who is willing to serve as the student's research advisor.  Students are expected to pick a research advisor by the end of their first semester in the program who will supervise their thesis or project. Each student, in consultation with their advisor, must submit an Academic Program preferably before completing 9 credit hours of coursework.  This should specify all courses and thesis work that will be counted toward the 30 credit hour requirement. </p>
<p>The research advisor will also serve as the student’s permanent academic advisor if they are a member of the department faculty.  If, however, the research advisor is not a member of the department faculty, the student is required to find a permanent academic advisor from the department faculty.  For students enrolled in an MS Thesis-Focused degree program, the research advisor is commonly known as the “thesis advisor”.</p>
<p>Students may change advisors for a variety of reasons of which one of the most common is a change of the student's field of interest.  It should be noted that a change in research advisor may require that the student start a new research project, which could result in delaying graduation.  It is the responsibility of the student to inform the ECSE Office of Student Affairs in the event of a change in advisor.  In addition, the student must file all appropriate forms with Graduate Studies.</p>
<h4>Appeals</h4>
<p>Any decision by an academic advisor, thesis guidance committee or department associate chairperson may be appealed, in writing, to the department associate chairperson who shall present the appeal, with their recommendations, to the faculty at its next regular faculty meeting. The faculty's decision shall be final.</p>
<h4>Other Regulations</h4>
<p>All students pursuing graduate studies in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering must abide by the academic regulations of the <a href="/schoolofgraduatestudies/academicrequirements/" target="_blank">School of Graduate Studies</a> and the Case School of Engineering contained in the most recent issue of the Bulletin of Case Western Reserve University, and supplemented by the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering regulations.</p>

<h3 headerid="5" name="graduatetext">PhD Degree Programs</h3>
<p>The Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering offers the following Doctor of Philosophy degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical Engineering PhD</li>
<li>Computer Engineering PhD</li>
<li>Systems and Control Engineering PhD</li>
</ul>
<h4>Admission</h4>
</div>
<p>Requirements for admission include a strong record of scholarship in a completed bachelor's degree program in a field of engineering, mathematical or physical sciences, and fluency in written and spoken English.  The University requires all foreign applicants to show English proficiency by achieving a TOEFL score of at least 577 on the paper-based exam or 90 on the internet-based exam. It is required that all students submit original copies of GRE scores.  Applications from students with a bachelor's degree in fields other than those listed above may be granted admission on a provisional basis.  Such provisional students may be advanced to full standing upon completion of prerequisite conditions stipulated in the letter of admission.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Course registration is performed through the Student Information System (SIS). Each semester before registration, students should update any personal information that may have changed by logging into SIS and editing the appropriate information.  All registration holds must be lifted in order to successfully complete the registration process.</p>
<h4>Advising</h4>
<p>Upon admission to the graduate program, each graduate student is assigned an academic advisor to assist in registration as well as planning a program of study (Academic Program).  This is a temporary assignment made by the Department Chairperson based on the student's academic and research interests as identified at the time of application. </p>
<p>During the first two semesters in the program, it is strongly suggested that each student meet with various members of faculty to discuss academic objectives/goals and research opportunities.  In order to complete the research component of their respective degree program, each student must identify a faculty member who is willing to serve as the student's research advisor.  The research advisor will also serve as the student’s permanent academic advisor if they are a member of the department faculty.  If, however, the research advisor is not a member of the department faculty, the student is required to find a permanent academic advisor from the department faculty. For students enrolled in the PhD program, the research advisor is commonly known as the “dissertation” advisor.</p>
<p>Each student is required to file an Academic Program, which must be approved by the student's advisor and the Department Chairperson, and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies.  Full-time PhD students should choose a research advisor and file an Academic Program before taking the qualifier but no later than the beginning of the third semester. Upon passing the qualifier, full-time PhD students will be required to assemble the dissertation guidance committee, prepare a dissertation proposal, and present this proposal to the committee for their approval. This process should be completed within one semester of passing the PhD qualifier.</p>
<p>The student shall be responsible for forming a dissertation guidance committee which shall consist of the student's academic advisor and additional faculty members recommended by the advisor.  For the PhD program, the minimum number of additional faculty members on the dissertation guidance committee is three, and at least two of the committee must be within the ECSE program areas (Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Systems and Control Engineering).  The chairperson of the dissertation guidance committee is normally the candidate's research advisor. </p>
<p>Students may change advisors for a variety of reasons of which one of the most common is a change of the student's field of interest.  It should be noted that a change in research advisor may require that the student start a new research project, which could result in delaying graduation.  It is the responsibility of the student to inform the ECSE Office of Student Affairs in the event of a change in advisor.</p>
<h4>Appeals</h4>
<p>Any decision by an academic advisor, dissertation guidance committee or Department Associate Chairperson may be appealed, in writing, to the Department Associate Chairperson who shall present the appeal, with their recommendations, to the faculty at its next regular faculty meeting. The faculty's decision shall be final.</p>
<h4>Other Regulations</h4>
<p>All students pursuing graduate studies in the Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering department must abide by the academic regulations of the <a href="/schoolofgraduatestudies/academicrequirements/" target="_blank">School of Graduate Studies</a> and the Case School of Engineering contained in the most recent issue of the Bulletin of Case Western Reserve University, and supplemented by the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering regulations.</p>
<h4>PhD Degree Program Requirements</h4>
<p>In order to successfully complete the PhD Degree Program, a student must satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a major dissertation subject area in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Systems and Control Engineering</li>
<li>Fulfill all PhD course requirements in the chosen major area (see individual degree requirements below)</li>

<h4>PhD Candidacy</h4>
<p>The final consideration of whether to admit the student to PhD candidacy will be taken by the PhD Qualifying Committee (for Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering students) or the student's dissertation guidance committee (for Systems and Control Engineering students) after the student has passed the PhD Qualifier. A written report on the results of the qualifier and PhD candidacy will be prepared by the committee and submitted to the Department Chairperson, who, in turn, will notify the School of Graduate Studies of the results.</p>
<h4>PhD Proposal</h4>
<p>After passing the Qualifier and being admitted to PhD candidacy, the PhD candidate is required to pass a Dissertation Proposal Exam on a timely basis, generally within one semester after being admitted to candidacy. This exam shall be administered by the student's dissertation guidance committee and consists of a written dissertation proposal and an oral presentation of the proposed dissertation research. As part of the oral presentation, the student will be expected to answer questions covering the proposed research as well as questions on related topics as deemed appropriate by the student's dissertation guidance committee. The written dissertation proposal must be received by the committee members at least ten days before the date scheduled for the oral exam and presentation. The Dissertation Proposal Exam, the PhD research, the final oral dissertation defense, and all other requirements in the student's PhD program of study must be completed within five years after the student is admitted to PhD candidacy.</p>
<h4>The PhD Oral Defense</h4>
<p>The student shall provide an announcement containing a title, abstract, date, time and location of the defense to the ECSE Office of Student Affairs for general distribution at least 10 days in advance of the thesis defense.</p>
<h4>The PhD Residency Requirements</h4>
<p>All PhD students shall fulfill the PhD residency requirements set forth by the Case School of Engineering and the <a href="/schoolofgraduatestudies/academicpolicies/" target="_blank">School of Graduate Studies</a>.

<h5>PhD Qualifying Examination</h5>
<p>A student shall be admitted to PhD candidacy only after they have passed the PhD Qualifying Examination. The Qualifying Exam is intended to test the students' knowledge in the student's chosen major program area of Electrical Engineering. The objectives of the exam are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To assess the PhD student's understanding of the fundamental concepts in Electrical Engineering as embodied in the respective graduate curriculum.</li>
<li>To ensure that the student have the ability to pursue PhD level research, and have mastered the graduate level coursework necessary to succeed as researchers</li>
</ol>
<p>Full-time PhD students are recommended to take the PhD qualifier before the beginning of their third semester of full-time (or equivalent) enrollment, and must pass the exam within two years of being admitted to the program. For part-time students, the Qualifying Exam must be passed before more than 27 credit hours of coursework have been completed. For students who must take remedial courses to make up for shortcomings in their engineering and mathematics knowledge base, the deadline can be extended to the fifth semester of full-time (or equivalent) enrollment, but this requires a petition to the ECSE Graduate Committee. Students have two opportunities to pass the PhD Qualifier. A student who fails to pass the Qualifier after two attempts will not be allowed to continue in the PhD program in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.</p>
<p>To pass the PhD Qualifier, the student must demonstrate proficiency in two parts:</p>
<h6><strong><em>Part 1: Electrical Engineering</em></strong></h6>
<p>The first part of the PhD Qualifier assesses the student's fundamental knowledge and proficiency in Electrical Engineering:</p>
<p><strong><u>For students matriculating after 8/1/2014:</u></strong></p>

<p class="courseblocktitle"><strong>ECSE 490.  Digital Image Processing.  3 Units.</strong></p>
<p class="courseblockdesc">
Digital images are introduced as two-dimensional sampled arrays of data.  The course begins with one-to-one operations such as image addition and subtraction and image descriptors such as the histogram.  Basic filters such as the gradient and Laplacian in the spatial domain are used to enhance images.  The 2-D Fourier transform is introduced and frequency domain operations such as high and low-pass filtering are developed.  It is shown how filtering techniques can be used to remove noise and other image degradation.  The different methods of representing color images are described and fundamental concepts of color image transformations and color image processing are developed.  One or more advanced topics such as wavelets, image compression, and pattern recognition will be covered as time permits.  Programming assignments using software such as MATLAB will illustrate the application and implementation of digital image processing.
