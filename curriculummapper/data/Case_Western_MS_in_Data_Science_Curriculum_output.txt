CSDS 442 Causal Learning from Data

This course introduces key concepts and techniques for characterizing, from observational or experimental study data and from background information, the causal effect of a specific treatment, exposure, or intervention (e.g., a medical treatment) upon an outcome of interest (e.g., disease status). The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.  Course grading will be based on quizzes, homeworks, a class presentation, and a causal data analysis project.

Specific topics: treatments, exposures, and interventions; causal effects and causal effect measures; confounding bias; potential outcomes and counterfactuals; randomized experiments; observational studies; causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); exchangeability and conditional exchangeability; effect modification; causal interactions; nonparametric structural equations; Pearl's Back-Door Criterion, Front-Door Criterion, and related results; covariate adjustment; matching on covariates; selection bias; measurement bias; instrumental variables; causal modeling; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; standardization; structural nested models; outcome regression; propensity scores; sensitivity analysis.

We will study different ways of representing the learning problem, using propositional, multiple-instance and relational representations.  We will study the different algorithms that have been developed for these settings, such as decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, k-means, harmonic functions and Bayesian methods.  We will learn about the theoretical tradeoffs in the design of these algorithms, and how to evaluate their behavior in practice.  At the end of the course, you should be able to:
   --Recognize situations where machine learning algorithms are applicable;
   --Understand, represent and formulate the learning problem;
   --Apply the appropriate algorithm(s), or if necessary, design your own, with an understanding of the tradeoffs involved;

CSDS 340D Machine Learning for Big Data

Machine learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms that "learn" and improve with experience, While the broad aim behind research in this area is to build systems that can simulate or even improve on certain aspects of human intelligence, algorithms developed in this area have become very useful in analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex systems. Machine learning algorithms have been used to guide diagnostic systems in medicine, recommend interesting products to customers in e-commerce, play games at human championship levels, and solve many other very complex problems. This course is an introduction to algorithms for machine learning and their implementation in the context of big data. We will study different learning settings, the different algorithms that have been developed for these settings, and learn about how to implement these algorithms and evaluate their behavior in practice. We will also discuss dealing with noise, missing values, scalability properties and talk about tools and libraries available for these methods.
At the end of the course, you should be able to:
--Understand when to use machine learning algorithms;
--Understand, represent and formulate the learning problem;
--Apply the appropriate algorithm(s) or tools, with an understanding of the tradeoffs involved including scalability and robustness;
--Correctly evaluate the behavior of the algorithm when solving the problem.

MATH 376 (aka MATH 376, BIOL 306) Mathematical Analysis of Biological Models

This course focuses on the mathematical methods used to analyze biological models, with examples drawn largely from ecology but also from epidemiology, developmental biology, and other areas.  Mathematical topics include equilibrium and stability in discrete and continuous time, some aspects of transient dynamics, and reaction-diffusion equations (steady state, diffusive instabilities, and traveling waves).  Biological topics include several "classic" models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model, the Ricker model, and Michaelis-Menten/type II/saturating responses.  The emphasis is on approximations that lead to analytic solutions, not numerical analysis.  An important aspect of this course is translating between verbal and mathematical descriptions: the goal is not just to solve mathematical problems but to extract biological meaning from the answers we find.

MATH 446 Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

This course is an introduction to numerical methods of PDEs, and in particular, to finite element methods (FEM), emphasizing the interconnection between the functional analytic viewpoint of PDEs and the practical and effective computation of the numerical approximations.  In particular, the emphasis is on showing that many of the useful and elegant ideas in finite dimensional linear algebra have a natural counterpart in the infinite dimensional setting of Hilbert spaces, and that the same techniques that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solutions in fact provide also stable computational methods to approximate the solutions.

The topics covered in this course include Fourier analysis, weak derivatives, weak forms, generalized functions; Sobolev spaces, trace theorem, compact embedding theorems, Poincare inequalities; Riesz theory, Fredholm theory; Finite Element Method (FEM): Grid generation, existence, stability and convergence of solutions for elliptic problems; Semi-discretization of parabolic and hyperbolic equations; Stiffness; Numerical solution of linear systems by iterative methods.

A quintessential part of this course comprises numerical implementation of the finite element method. Matlab is used as the programming tool both in demonstrations and examples in the class as well as in home assignments.

Recommended Preparation: linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and ordinary differential equations.

In this course, we will learn data science and analysis approaches to identify statistically significance relationships and better model and predict the behavior of these systems. We will assemble and explore real-world datasets, perform clustering and pair plot analyses to investigate correlations, and logistic regression will be employed to develop associated predictive models. Results will be interpreted, visualized and discussed. We will introduce basic elements of statistical analysis using R Project open source software for exploratory data analysis and model development. R is an open-source software project with broad abilities to access machine-readable open-data resources, data cleaning and munging functions, and a rich selection of statistical packages, used for data analytics, model development and prediction. This will include an introduction to R data types, reading and writing data, looping, plotting and regular expressions, so that one can start performing variable transformations for linear fitting and developing structural equation models, while exploring for statistically significant relationships.

DSCI 453 (aka DSCI 453, DSCI 353, DSCI 353M) Data Science: Statistical Learning, Modeling and Prediction

In this course, we will use an open data science tool chain to develop reproducible data analyses useful for inference, modeling and prediction of the behavior of complex systems. In addition to the standard data cleaning, assembly and exploratory data analysis steps essential to all data analyses, we will identify statistically significant relationships from datasets derived from population samples, and infer the reliability of these findings. We will use regression methods to model a number of both real-world and lab-based systems producing predictive models applicable in comparable populations. We will assemble and explore real-world datasets, use pair-wise plots to explore correlations, perform clustering, self-similarity, and logistic regression develop both fixed-effect and mixed-effect predictive models. We will introduce machine-learning approaches for classification and tree-based methods. Results will be interpreted, visualized and discussed. We will introduce the basic elements of data science and analytics using R Project open source software. R is an open-source software project with broad abilities to access machine-readable open-data resources, data cleaning and assembly functions, and a rich selection of statistical packages, used for data analytics, model development, prediction, inference and clustering. With this background, it becomes possible to start performing variable transformations for linear regression fitting and developing structural equation models, fixed-effects and mixed-effects models along with other statistical learning techniques, while exploring for statistically significant relationships. The class will be structured to have a balance of theory and practice. We'll split class into Foundation and Practicum a) Foundation: lectures, presentations, discussion b) Practicum: coding, demonstrations and hands-on data science work. The M section of

DSCI 354 (aka DSCI 354M, DSCI 354, DSCI 454) Data Visualization and Analytics

Data Visualization and Analytics students will learn data visualization and analytics techniques focused on different types of data such as time-series, spectral, or image data science problems. This class will focus on increasing analysis of complex data sets through visualization by enhancing exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. This class will focus on creating effective data visualizations to communicate data analytics results to different audiences. Different datasets will be provided to develop different types of visualizations and analytics. Types of data visualizations include in interactive plots (e.g., bar graphs change over time), applications that allow users to adjust the visualizations based on their decisions (e.g., shiny applications), interactive maps, 3-D plots of data, etc. Discussing how an audience understands information and brings in data as well as the ethics of making data visualizations will be discussed. The class will also include ways to increase modeling and analysis with effective visualizations for credible, data-driven decision making. This will include a git repository for other students to use these codes as open source resources and the preparation of reproducible data science analyses for different types of problems.
