The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.  Course grading will be based on quizzes, homeworks, a class presentation, and a causal data analysis project.\n\nSpecific topics: treatments, exposures, and interventions; causal effects and causal effect measures; confounding bias; potential outcomes and counterfactuals; randomized experiments; observational studies; causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); exchangeability and conditional exchangeability; effect modification; causal interactions; nonparametric structural equations; Pearl\u0027s Back-Door Criterion, Front-Door Criterion, and related results; covariate adjustment; matching on covariates; selection bias; measurement bias; instrumental variables; causal modeling; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; standardization; structural nested models; outcome regression; propensity scores; sensitivity analysis.\nPrereqs:\nEECS 440\nMATH 380\nSTAT 312\nSTAT 313\nSTAT 333\nSTAT 332\n"}, {"color": "#5c5c5c", "group": 0, "id": "STAT 382", "label": "STAT 382", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "High Dimensional Probability: \nBehavior of random vectors, random matrices, and random projections in high dimensional spaces, with a view toward applications to data sciences.

The course begins with introduction to \u0027tensorflow\u0027 a scalable and deployable programming platform for building neural network architectures. The first theory lecture introduces to the world of computer vision along with traditional approaches and a comparison is drawn between traditional methods and DL for computer vision. In the following lectures multiple advanced neural network architectures are taught along with their application usecases (visual inspection, medical imaging, object detection, OCR, Face recognition, video analysis, etc.). Computer vision is followed by introduction to NLP and traditional techniques like HMMs and CRFs followed by DL architectures for sequence (text, video, audio, speech etc.) modeling. Different application usecases (NER, language modeling, speech recognition, etc.) along along with required theory are presented. Introduction to reinforcement learning and its combination with deep learning is presented towards the end of the course. During the labs all steps of building an application, from the training of the model to its deployment, are discussed. How to combine traditional methods with DL and possible usecases are also discussed. The objective of the course is to make the participants familiar with the state-of-the-art DL and RL techniques for real world problems along with the knowledge to implement solution pipelines.

The art of formulating linear programs is taught through the use of systematic model-building techniques.  The simplex algorithm for solving these models is developed from several points of view: geometric, conceptual, algebraic, and economic.  The role and uses of duality theory are also presented.  Students learn to obtain and interpret a solution from a computer package and how to use the associated output to answer \"What-happens-if...\" questions that arise in post-optimality analysis.  Specific topics include: problem formulation, geometric and conceptual solution procedures, the simplex algorithm (phase 1 and phase 2), obtaining and interpreting computer output, duality theory, and sensitivity analysis.  The second half of this course provide a practical approach to formulating and solving combinatorial optimization problems in the areas of networks, dynamic programming, project management (CPM), integer programming, and nonlinear programming.  The art of formulating problems, understanding what is involved in solving them, and obtained and interpreting the solution from a computer package are shown.  A comparison with formulating and solving linear programming problems is provided as a way to understand the advantages and disadvantages of some of these problems and solutions procedures.

This traditional epistemological framework has been challenged by the developments of the modern era of Big Science, resulting in the development of new approaches to a social epistemology of science.  Reflective of how science is done, this epistemological framework in turn can provide guidance for the robust prosecution of the scientific enterprise.  Perhaps nowhere is this more important than in climate science, where on the one hand the underlying dynamics of climate change pose an existential threat to our civilization, and on the other, there are active and well organized efforts to derail the scientific process and to denigrate the scientists.\nThis course will first develop classical notions of the epistemology of science, including the role of models and issues of uncertainty (statistical, systematic, and gross) as well as the challenges of developing a robust scientific process resistant to fraud. These issues will be illustrated by consideration of various classical experiments.  The course will then expand the epistemological framework to the collaborative context of modern big science, illustrating the issues by examples from the field of high energy physics (which saw the development of the World Wide Web by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, to allow physicists from around the world to share and collectively analyze data).  With this in hand the course will explore the history and current state of climate science in the framework of a social epistemology of big science. Students will develop a good understanding of the role of hierarchical models of climate science, the empirical basis for our current understanding of anthropogenic climate change, the role and development of international coordination of climate science and its implications for policy, and the challenges posed by hostile, well-organized efforts to disrupt the scientific process, the public understanding of the science, and ultimately the processes necessary for addressing the challenges of climate change.\n"}, {"color": "#8c8c8c", "group": 0, "id": "WGST 314", "label": "WGST 314", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "Innovation and French Science:  Past, Present, and Future: \nThe French scientific enterprise over the past 250 years has been buffeted by politics, war, civil unrest, and economic and societal changes.
